Location of spring season net samples by the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) used in analyses of abundance and trends in pelagic resources in two regions: Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary region (red) includes CalCOFI stations inside and adjacent to CINMS; and Southern California Shelf (yellow) includes all CalCOFI stations over the shelf.

figures/CINMS-ConditionReport_2016/App.F.12.18_CalCOFI_SPV.png,"Figure App.F.12.18. Mean volume of small plankton collected in net samples during CalCOFI cruises at only sites in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary region (top) and all sites over the Southern California Shelf (bottom) from 1978 to 2015 (sampling locations shown in Figure App.F.12.17). Horizontal lines show the mean (dashed line) ± 1.0 standard deviation (solid lines) over the full time series. Symbol at upper right indicates whether data over the last five years (green shaded areas) had a positive trend (), a negative trend (), or no trend (↔). Symbol at lower right indicates whether the mean over the past five years was greater than (+), less than (–), or within 1 standard deviation (●) of the mean of the full time series..

Micro-debris was present in more than 50 percent of samples at each time period. Figure: Gilfillan et al. 2009",Condition Report,Channel Islands
